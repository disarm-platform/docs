The DiSARM project previously hosted live instances of the DiSARM app with the related backend server and database. They were used live in-country for 2-3 seasons between 2016 and 2018. They were accessible at URLs like `<COUNTRY>.app.disarm.io`. 

Having served their purpose, these instances are no longer in production use and have been retired.

The data has been exported and shared with relevant countries.

To try a current demo of the app, check the instructions for the [demo](/app-docs.demo.md).
