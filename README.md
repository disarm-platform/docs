# Home

This site contains documentation on outputs from the DiSARM project, including the DiSARM app and the DiSARM API \(Application Programming Interface\). In addition, it contains documentation and tools to help other algorithm developers deploy their algorithms as an API. Deploying an algorithm as an API allows it to be integrated into user interfaces and data pipelines. For more information on the whole project, visit the main project website at [https://www.disarm.io](https://www.disarm.io).

## [DiSARM API \(Algorithms via API\)](api-docs/)

The _API_ is the main entry point to the project's modelling and algorithms work. For more detailed documentation, and to access the headless and UI versions of the algorithms, see [here](api-docs/).

## [DiSARM app \(Prototype planning and monitoring app\)](app-docs/)

The _app_ is a user application for the planning and monitoring of field-based campaigns.
