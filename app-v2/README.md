# App manual (v2)

# Introduction

This document has been prepared for the end user of the DiSARM application once it has been set up and ready to use. It covers the general information of the application including how to download it, what to do if it is not working well and how to use the data collection, planner, and dashboard sections of the DiSARM application.



 

**General**
===========

**What is DiSARM?**
-------------------

The Disease Surveillance and Risk Monitoring platform (DiSARM) is a spatial intelligence tool, built to enable disease control programs to deliver more effective field campaigns. The platform combines an interface used to pull together, collect and visualize data with a powerful back-end analytics engine to convert raw data into actionable information. The DiSARM platform consists of four modules: data collector, planner, dashboard and administration. The platform can be used for any activity that involves spatial data/heat maps, data collection and data analysing and reformatting into charts and graphs. While the internet is needed to sync your data with the online tools, data input can continue to occur while offline.

The platform is currently being used by malaria programs in four countries in southern Africa to help plan, execute and monitor indoor residual spraying campaigns.\"

More information on the DiSARM platform can be found at [[www.disarm.io]{.underline}](http://www.disarm.io).

 

**How to download DiSARM**
--------------------------

**NOTE**: The "restart application" button will bring you back to the Login page.

Resetting the application will log you out. Make sure to do it if you are not using the application offline (if you have network) to log back in as it is not possible to log in if you do not have network.

 

**Updating**
------------

1.  When the DISARM application is connected to the internet, it will automatically check to see if a new version is available. If a new version is available, it will download automatically and update in the background. You can continue to use the application during the download. Your data will not be affected by the update. When an update is being downloaded, a message stating "Update Downloading" will show at the top right corner of the toolbar.

You can dismiss the message by clicking it.

![](./media/app-image27.png)

> **NOTE:** Updates may not be successful due to slow internet connection. If the update is unsuccessful or your browser freezes during the download, try a "forced reload" by pressing Ctrl+Shift+R on Windows (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac). on a mobile phone touch the screen at the top and drag to the bottom. The application will automatically attempt to download the update again. Your data will not be removed as a result of the forced reload. However, **any unsaved forms (incomplete data collection in the record point module) may be deleted.**

**User Page**
-------------

1.  The first page you will see after clicking the "login"After logging button is the User Page. It lists the sections of the application you are allowed to access pre-selected by your application administrator. These sections are sometimes referred to as modules and a user who has full access will have:

-   IRS Monitor

-   IRS Plan

-   IRS Record

-   Debug

-   Geodata

> **NOTE:** Some application modules will have customized names and a higher or smaller number of modules based on the configurations of your application administrator.

Below the list of modules the text text shows your the version number of your application. When clicked it displays the version number of your configuration and some more device information that includes your browser name, version, operating system and your device name.

![](./media/app-image114.jpg)

 

**Sidebar**
-----------

1.  After logging into the DiSARM application, you can view your modules in the sidebar. These modules are the same as those listed on the User Page and are pre-selected by your application administrator. To open the Sidebar, click the sandwich icon (three small horizontal lines icon) on the top left corner of the screen.

> ![](./media/app-image46.png)
>
> The Side Bar will display the following information:

-   Title given to you DiSARM application

-   Version of the DiSARM application being used

-   Instance ID (also referred to as testing ID is set during log in so that testing data and settings are not saved with real data) *not always there*

-   Modules made available by your application administrator

-   User Page navigation option

-   Help option

-   Logout option

> ![](./media/app-image110.png)
>
> 2\. Close the Sidebar by clicking anywhere outside of the Side

![](./media/app-image102.png)

 

**Data Collection**
-------------------

The DiSARM application has a built in "form builder" that tailors itself based on the data entered by the user. To begin entering data into the DiSARM application:

1.  Select the "Data Collection/IRS Record" module from the User Page or Sidebar. When you visit the data collection module for the first time you will be presented with a page that looks like:

![](./media/app-image89.png)

2.  To add a new record, click the + sign in the top left corner.

> ![](./media/app-image99.png)

3.  The meta data page might be configured to be displayed or not displayed by your application administrator, but if it is shown it has fields that are optional. Some of them can be changed and some cannot be changed, this depends on the settings applied by your application administrator. The one shown below displays the username of the logged in user, their user ID, a time stamp or record collection and the team name the user belongs to.

> ![](./media/app-image12.png)

4.  Enter your data into the form as prompted. This form has been configured by your application administrator. Generally the first part of collecting a record is the location selection. The standard location selection page is shown below:

![](./media/app-image59.png)

5.  To collect the GPS coordinates of your location you click on the "GET/UPDATE POINT LOCATION"

> ![](./media/app-image70.png)

6.  To set the name of the admin location as provided in the geodata you click on the "locality dropdown". As shown in the image below, the higher level (first location selection) is optional in this case because the lower level locality is the part of the higher level level one (it is an area inside the region).

> ![](./media/app-image41.png)

7.  If the location you are looking for is not shown in the locality dropdown you can add a custom by clicking on the "Enter custom location" checkbox

> ![](./media/app-image54.png)

8.  A pop up message will ask you to confirm that you want to add a custom location and if you are sure you nac click on "USE CUSTOM LOCATION". The downside with adding a custom location is that it will not be shown on the dashboard.

> ![](./media/app-image69.png)

9.  To continue adding the custom location select the text field labeled "custom location' and type the name of the location that you want to add if you did not find it on the location dropdown shown on step 6 of this section.

![](./media/app-image29.png)

10. While adding the records (filling in the form) if you miss a required field or put in a invalid value errors will be shown at the top of the screen.

![](./media/app-image43.png)

11. When you click on the button you will be shown where the errors are. In the example shown below the user forgot to get the GPS coordinates of the location. Clicking on the red text in the same line as the error message will make the erratic part be displayed below the error messages for the user to fix them instantly.

> ![](./media/app-image44.png)

12. To continue filling in the form use the buttons at the bottom to navigate through the pages of the form until you rich the last page which will have the navigation buttons labeled previous and complete. Once the form is filled in with required data standards the "complete" button will be activated. All it does is save the complete form to your device only.

> ![](./media/app-image52.png)

13. When you click it you will be brought back to the main page of the data Data Collection/IRS Record that is shown on the first step of this section. The difference is that it will display the list of records that you have collected. If you have not synced them yet it will look like the image shown below. The user has collected 148 records and has not synced any of them. Syncing in our context means sending the records to the main database so that they can be downloaded by users who have access to the dashboard to view spray campaign progress, for this reason you have to be connected to the internet to be able to sync.

![](./media/app-image16.png)

14. If you click on a record on the screen shown above you will be able to edit it. You can change any of the fields that you were able to input data into while collecting the record for the first time. So when you select one record you will be taken to the screen shown in step 3 only with the data already filled in in all pages but editable.

> Otherwise the next step is to either sync the records or export the so you can have them on your device as a json file. These two options can be displayed by clicking on the three vertical dots button
>
> ![](./media/app-image34.png)

15. The option to sync or export the data is not available unless you have records that need to be synced or exported. You can filter through the records using one of the values from form fields from the data collector form. This field is selected configured by your application administrator.

> ![](./media/app-image85.png)

16. If the user wishes to have this records saved on an external json file on the mobile device; "export unsynced " should be clicked. The app will instantly compile the json file and start the download. A notification will be shown in the notifications area at the top and a pop up at the bottom.

> ![](./media/app-image32.png)

17. To sync the records the user should select the first option that is shown on step 15 of this section. The image below was taken after the records had been synced. You can see the ticks on the left of each record and the notification at the top stating the number of records that were synced

> ![](./media/app-image58.png)
>
> **NOTE:** After synching you will not be able to not be edit the records and you will not be able to export a json file of the records. If you want to get records you will be able to download them from the dashboard/monitor if you have permissions to access it. It is still possible to view records by clicking on them.

**Dashboard/Monitor**
---------------------

The Dashboard Monitor module is used for visualising your data after it is uploaded into the DiSARM application. It can produce visualizations in the form of charts, graphs, tables and geographic displays.

When you first visit it you will be presented with a window that has the map of the geodata that was uploaded by the application administrator. By default the map will be showing the risk layout of malaria over your geodata. The application will load the plans so that they can be selected to be viewed on the map. A pop up will be shown to show if plans were retrieved successfully, and it non exist yet the application will display a pop up message with no "plans loaded"

![](./media/app-image21.png)

The three dotted button when clicked shows four options. It is shown on the top left corner of the page

![](./media/app-image90.png)

The first option "load plans" (shown in the image below) is useful when the user has created a new plan on the IRS plan module or section.the plan will need to be loaded on the monitor module. So the load plan option will download the plan from the planner section and get it ready to be used on the map should the user want to view everything (record points, spray progress ) restricted to the plan.

![](./media/app-image6.png)

To download responses the user must select "Retrieve responses" and this means is that responses that have been uploaded/synched by different users who were collecting data using the data collector/record collector module. Note: This only bring the records to the monitor module, it does refer to downloading them to the local storage of the user's device.

![](./media/app-image109.png)

When the user clicks download the application will pop up a message "retrieving more records" as shown in the image below:![](./media/app-image101.png)

Once completed the message will change to "successfully retrieved responses":

![](./media/app-image76.png)

The third option, "Re-retrieve all" responses downloads responses again. It is useful in the case where more records have been uploaded/synced by other users after you had already used the retrieve responses option. Once clicked it follows the same steps illustrated above to retrieve the responses.

![](./media/app-image79.png)

The last option, "Download responses" will be activated only when record points are showing on the map. When clicked it instantly downloads a Comma Separated Values (CSV) of the records.

Note: this is restricted to the records showing on the map before or after applying filters only. So if the records have been filtered by plan or dates, therecords filtered out will not be downloaded, only the ones showing on the map will be put in the CSV file and downloaded.

![](./media/app-image100.png)

Next to the buttons in the bar the text illustrates whether you have loaded a plan, number of records showing on the map (retrieved) and the time and date when you last downloaded records and loaded the plan. In the example below 245 records have been retrieved.

![](./media/app-image3.png)

This is how the text looks in a close view:

![](./media/app-image68.png)

### Controls

![](./media/app-image91.png)

The "Controls" drop down menu contains different kinds of tools that can be used to set aggregations and filter the records. When you click on the Controls it opens a panel with six tabs titled:

-   SEASON/PLAN

-   FORM FIELDS

-   TEMPORAL

-   SPATIAL

-   AGGREGATIONS

-   ADVANCED.

The image below shows how the controls section looks like when you open it by clicking anywhere on the "Controls" bar (shown in the previous image).

![](./media/app-image96.png)

1.  SEASON → The first item on this tab is a selector marked "select season start date". When clicked it pops up a list of season start dates and when the user selects one of these it sets a filter that will make the dashboard display records that were recorded on that date and later on till the date before another season starts. Season start dates are added by the administrator in the configuration file.

> ![](./media/app-image28.png)
>
> Clicking on the dropdown in the red rectangle above will get the seasons start dates and you can choose one as shown in the image below:
>
> ![](./media/app-image80.png)

2.  PLAN → the plan is a list of areas selected in planner module and set aside as areas where spraying will be done. If there is a plan that has been created in the planner module the user will click on the load plan selector and will be presented with the list of plans. Selecting one will make the dashboard display and aggregate records that are inside the areas selected when creating the plan. Plans are automatically retrieved from the planner module when opening the dashboard, the user only needs to click on the one they would like to load on the map. If there is no plan created the selector will display the text; "No plans loaded - create a Plan and then click 'Load plans' in the menu above'" and it will be in inactive (not functional).

> ![](./media/app-image30.png)
>
> When plans have been created the selector will have the text "select plan" and once clicked on it will display the plan names so the user can choose one as shown below;![](./media/app-image112.png)

3.  FORM FIELDS → The second tab in the Controls is used for filtering according to a type of identifiable piece of information collected. For example, the form field allows you to sort your data by field name, username, recorded\_at and etc. theses form fields come from your records. The application checks all the properties or fields you records include and then lists them in this part to use for filtering. Select how you would like to sort your date by clicking on the drop down menu, select either "equals" or "not equals to", then put the value you want to compare with and lastly click the add filter button.

> ![](./media/app-image104.png)
>
> In the example below once the "ADD FILTER" button is clicked only records with the value 3 for the number of bendnets field will be shown.
>
> ![](./media/app-image107.png)
>
> The results are shown in the image below. There are three areas marked in red where the application shows that there are filters that have been applied. This means that the data that is shown is missing as only records where there were three bed nets are showing. If the user decides to download all records with the filters applied they will get the number of records that were left after applying filters ( in this case only records with where the number of bednets was 3)
>
> ![](./media/app-image40.png)

4.  TEMPORAL FILTER → the temporal filter has two text fields which you can tailor to display records that lie in a specific range of dates.

> ![](./media/app-image36.png)
>
> To navigate around the calender the user can use the arrows to go forward or backwards in the level of what is presented at the top center of the calendar, by default it is by month. If you click on it it goes to years and displays months below, when clicked again it will go to year displaying a decade in each page. Once you select a year it will show you the months and when you chose one it will show you the days and you can choose one.
>
> ![](./media/app-image98.png)
>
> The text fields are labeled "from" and "to". Once there are dates in both from and two the "add filter" button will be activated and when clicked it will make dashboard show records that are in between those dates. The date in the "from" field should be earlier than the "to" filed, so if one of the calendars becomes inactive the user must ensure the dates are arranged well.
>
> ![](./media/app-image33.png)
>
> This time as shown in the picture above the application will say that there are two filters active because there are the two dates, one filter is restricting to show records later than the selected date and the other filter is restring to show records recorded before the selected date. The user can select one date if they want and then click on "add filter" and there will be only one filter showing records before or after the selected date depending on which date field was used. The reset button removes the dates that were previously selected to filter by.

5.  SPATIAL FILTER → the spatial filter is used for showing records that are in a certain geographical area. The application can filter to whichever level your geographic data was collected (e.g. country, region, district, village/community).

> ![](./media/app-image87.png)
>
> The spatial filter, as shown above, is found on the fourth tab of the controls section. The user needs to click on the drop downs there(labelled "select area" and "select sub-area") and click on each one to show the list of areas there are.
>
> ![](./media/app-image25.png)
>
> Once clicked the drop down will show a list of areas for the user to choose the one which they want to filter with. There may be more than one drop down in other cases, it depends on how many levels the geodata has and in our example there are only two with the higher level being a region. The image below shows what is displayed after clicking the top drop down to see the regions.
>
> ![](./media/app-image42.png)
>
> The image shown below is what is displayed after choosing an area. The options inside the red rectangle ("Select sub-are" and "ADD FILTER") are not active/functional unless the user has selected an area on the top drop down for the higher level areas of the geodata. The "Select subarea" is not active because it shows sub-areas that are inside the area or region which should be selected above. The "ADD FILTER"is only active after selecting an area on top drop down to give the user an option to filter with only that area/region (by doing so showing all the records in the sub-areas that are in that area).
>
> ![](./media/app-image65.png)

6.  AGGREGATIONS → The fifth tab on the controls is used to change the way the records are displayed by grouping them inside time ranges and location. When you open the tab you will be presented with two sections:spatial aggregation and temporal aggregation.

> Under spatial aggregation depending on your instance setup you will be able to aggregate according to the list of levels your geodata has. In other instances there might be more options. The change will be effected on the table that is below the map on the dashboard. The records are displayed in a grouped format (aggregated) according to the button that has been selected among the ones in the spatial aggregation. In our example the option we have are the small areas which in our instance are called sub-areas. The name "locality" comes from the geodata name given by the administrator when setting up the DiSARM application.
>
> ![](./media/app-image37.png)
>
> The table that is being referred to above is shown below and as mentioned it is found below the map on IRS monitor module:
>
> Note: it is only shown if there are records shown in the map so it will not be there if there are no records retrieved, or if all the records have been filtered and non fitted the required criteria.

![](./media/app-image82.png)

> The second section, temporal aggregation, affects the way the graphs are displayed below the table in the dashboard. The bar graph that displays coverage has the bars labelled according to the aggregation selected. They could labeled with week dates, months, quarters of the year or years.
>
> Graph visualizations aggregated by week are implemented by selecting "week" on temporal aggregation as shown below:
>
> ![](./media/app-image14.png)
>
> And graphs will be displayed in the format shown below:
>
> ![](./media/app-image62.png)
>
> Graph visualizations aggregated by months of the year are implemented by selecting monthly on temporal aggregation as shown below:
>
> ![](./media/app-image84.png)
>
> Graph visualizations aggregated by month:
>
> ![](./media/app-image81.png)
>
> If the user desires the graphs can be aggregated to display progress further aggregated quarterly or yearly.

7.  ADVANCED →The advanced tab will have options that are not used in normal circumstances but make a huge difference in you monitor tab once used. Users should be cautious in this section since any changes made here will impact the results displayed on the monitor page by showing a different number of points than the ones included in coverage calculations.

> On this tab the user is presented with a warning message as shown below on the image and below the warning there is a checkbox labeled "**Include Responses and geodata outside Plan**". This is where the user will choose to ignore the plan created in the planner module and show all the records that were collected including those that are in areas that were not included in the plan. ![](./media/app-image72.png)
>
> Once checked a warning message will be shown that: "The checkbox above means you are showing responses outside the plan. This will display responses on the map and include them in aggregation calculations, but note that they will not be included in any coverage calculations. Uncheck to limit responses to the plan."
>
> So if the user clicks on it, it gets checked and then the dashboard shows all the responses on the map but does not include them in coverage calculations.
>
> In the example shown below the user has ten records inside the plan, after clicking/checking the checkbox to show records that are outside of the plan the number of records increased by six to be show sixteen records.
>
> Before showing records outside of the plan:
>
> ![](./media/app-image116.png)
>
> After including records that are outside of the plan
>
> ![](./media/app-image83.png)
>
> The option to select "guess locations" is used to add GPS coordinates for records that are missing the GPS coordinates. Sometimes the application administrator will set the collection of GPS coordinates optional so that if the device does not manage to collect GPS coordinates when offline the user still manages to record that they sprayed somewhere.![](./media/app-image31.png)height="2.0416666666666665in"}

### Map

The map is shown in monitor module below the "Controls" section that has been discussed above. It is used to see in which areas there record point have been collected (using the IRS record module).

![](./media/app-image66.png)

The user can zoom in or out of the map around the map by clicking on the plus or minus buttons in the top right corner.

![](./media/app-image24.png)

To view other sections of the map, click and drag on the map to reveal the hidden, or use the arrow buttons on your keyboard. To change points of view on the map (e.g make it look flat) you can click and hold on to the button on the top right corner that is labeled with up and down arrows, then move the mouse till you find the position you desire. As an alternative hold shift on your keyboard and press the up and down arrow buttons until you have adjusted to the view you would like.

If there are records that have loaded on the map, they will appear as dots located on the map.![](./media/app-image106.png)

If your application administrator has defined decorations, the response points will be in different colors. Red dots mean the structure has not been sprayed and green dots mean the structure has been sprayed. Note: The colors may be defined to mean different things by the application administrator.

When clicking on a dot, a summary of the record will be shown. The information shown in the summary is determined by the application administrator. ![](./media/app-image11.png)height="3.299504593175853in"}

When a plan is loaded, the map will paint the areas that were selected when making the plan in a different color that stands out. The color depends on the layer that has been selected below the map. There is a selector labeled "show areas by". Between the selector and the map there is a legend bar labeled zero to 100 with its color changing after 10 units.

In the example below the layer selected is "risk", the legend at the bottom shows that the red areas have a higher risk of malaria, while the on the low risk the color is almost blue.

![](./media/app-image19.png)

The layers below include risk, coverage and sprayed structures. If the user selects a layer (e.g. coverage), the application will color the areas on the map according to the colors of the bar between the map and the selector as indicated by the records to be in sync with how much has been covered in different areas. If a lot of areas were sprayed in a rea the color of an area will be blue and if nothing was sprayed the area will be red.

Risk layer with a plan with a plan that covers the southern part of the map

![](./media/app-image48.png)

Structures Sprayed % layer. Note that there no records loaded, so the application has all the structures not sprayed and that is why it is all painted red.

![](./media/app-image51.png)

The image below shows a checkbox labeled show response points, if the user unchecks it (by default it is checked) it will make the response points not show on the map. This will not affect the aggregations or the charts.

Note: this checkbox will not be active/functional unless there are records shown on the map.

The summary table is located in the dashboard/monitor monitor and contains the data from the response points that are being shown on the map. If the user has retrieved records and there are records displayed on the map, this table will be populated with those results otherwise the table will not be displayed if there are no records showing.

![](./media/app-image74.png)

The columns shown in the summary table depend on the settings applied by the application administrator in the configuration file. The table has been designed to allow users to search their records using the text field at the top left corner labeled "Filter Results".

![](./media/app-image26.png)

On the top right corner there is a number field which labeled "Records." By default, the application will show 10 records per page. This number can be adjusted to show more or less records per page.

![](./media/app-image20.png)

Below the summary table, users are able to jump to specific pages by using the navigation bar shown below in the red rectangle.

![](./media/app-image93.png)

Below the navigation bar, users can choose to "Download" the summary table into a Comma Separated Values (CSV) file which can be opened using software programs such as Microsoft Excel.

Note: The button found underneath the table downloads the table as it is. In this example the table has been configured to show the columns name (of an area), structures sprayed and structures sprayed %. So it will download summaries not the actual records.

### Graphs and Charts

The last section of the monitor is the graphical view of your spraying activity. This involves line graphs, bar graphs, pie charts and more. It all depends on how your DiSARM instance is set up. These graphs are set based on the information that you have collected using the record module.

Graphs without any records uploaded will appear blank and will only show the types of information being collected:

The disarm application is capable of displaying the graphs that are shown below for more examples:

**Planner**
-----------

1.  The planner is a section that is used for selecting the areas where the spraying activity will be carried out. This module is very useful on the IRS monitor module where you can view the progress of your spraying. It is not mandatory to use this section of the application as the application is built to use all the geodata as the plan if there are no plans created.

> When you visit it you will see a display like the one shown below, only it will have your geodata not the one shown below so the map will be different.

![](./media/app-image92.png)

2.  The planner has two buttons on the top left corner, one has a pencil icon while the other has three vertical dots. The pencil icon allows users to edit or create a plan. The user will need to click once on it so that they can select or deselect areas on the map

![](./media/app-image38.png)

3.  Once clicked on it will change color to orange and the user will be able to click on areas on the map to add them to the plan.

> ![](./media/app-image53.png)

4.  When areas are selected/clicked they also change color to indicate to the user they are in the plan being created. The user can select as many areas as they want

> ![](./media/app-image108.png)

5.  The user can also create a plan by drawing a polygon around the area they want to be to in the plan. This can be don by clicking on the small square icon on the right of the map area. If you hover over the icone a tooltip is displayed showing its name (Polygon too(p))

> ![](./media/app-image78.png)

6.  Once you have clicked it the mouse pointer changes to a small + sign, signifying that you can start drawing your polygon. As you click to make corners of your polygon you will notice that it is always a closed shape. To finish just go to click on the first point you made when drawing the polygon and you will see by having a dot while like the previous corner you made, while all other corners will not not have dots

![](./media/app-image57.png)

7.  Once you close your polygon the application will instantly add to your plan all the unit areas that are fully inside the polygon with no parts of them outside. As mentioned above they will be painted in a different color to show that they are in the plan too. ![](./media/app-image23.png)

8.  If the user wants to zoom in or zoom out on the map they can use the + and - icons show on the right of the map. The third icon with up and down icon in the same area of the zoom in and out icons is used for changing the elevation view of the map.

> ![](./media/app-image111.png)

9.  Another way to create a plan is by using the risk slider that is shown below the map. When providing your geodata you can specify the risk of catching malaria of each admin unit/area which will be then used by the DiSARM application to help you select only areas that have a risk with minimum being the point of your choosing on the scale to put in your plan.

> ![](./media/app-image5.png)

NOTE: the risk slider will not be displayed unless the pencil icon at the top right has been click putting the plan editing mode on.

10. To save you plan you must go on the three vertical dots button at the top right ot see the options

> ![](./media/app-image105.png)

11. The options shown when the button is clicked are

<!-- -->

a)  Load plan → paints the map with the plan that you will choose to load

b)  Save plan → saves the plan that you are currently creating/editing

c)  Clear plan → unselects all the areas that you had selected on the map so you have zero select areas on the plan.

![](./media/app-image17.png)

12. Once you have finished selecting the areas that you want to include in your plan you can choose the save plan option. If it is your first time saving a plan, a pop up message will be shown with a text field to put in the name of your plan.

> ![](./media/app-image10.png)

13. It will pop up a list of the plans you have if you have plans saved already for you click on the "update" button to replace them with whatever edits you made. ![](./media/app-image61.png)height="6.286458880139983in"}

14. If the user wants to view existing plans, the way to go is to start on the three dotted button on the top left part of the screen.

> ![](./media/app-image97.png)

15. The next step will be a list of the plans that have been created in the application before. The user has to select the one that they want to view by clicking on the name of the pla. Looking closely to the names of the plans, the user will notice that dates of when the plans were last edited are shown underneath each plan name to make differentiation between the plans easier.

> ![](./media/app-image4.png)

16. Once a plan has been selected to be viewed, the top shows a campaign summary. The DiSARM platform has algorithms that calculate how long a team will take to complete spraying the selected areas that make up the plan. This is facilitated by other algorithms that get information from the Malaria Atlas Program of how many structures there are in the area and the estimated number of rooms.

![](./media/app-image8.png)

17. The user has the option to download a geojson file for the plan. The geojson is a format designed for representing simple geographical features, along with their non-spatial attributes. The "DOWNLOAD PLAN GEOJSON" button instantly downloads the a geojson file of the plan that was being viewed (selected after load plan on step 15)

> ![](./media/app-image39.png)

18. While viewing the plan you will also be shown a table which displays the areas names, number of structures in them and the risk in each of the areas that are included in the plan.

![](./media/app-image67.png)

19. The "DOWNLOAD PLAN TABLE" button is used to download the plan information. It results in an instant download of a (comma-separated values) CSV file.

![](./media/app-image77.png)

20. The download notification will be shown and the file will be found in your downloads folder:

![](./media/app-image15.png)

21. The plan section of the application can also be used to show which parts of your geodata have high risks of malaria. This is activated by clicking on the "show risk" checkbox below the map. As the legend shows below the map, the areas with red and dark red colors are the ones with the highest risk of malaria.

![](./media/app-image13.png)

**Geographic Data**
-------------------

When you are opening the DiSARM app on your device for the first time the geographic data is also loaded. If it happens that the application administrator loads some new geographic data the application should load the new data automatically. If that does not happen follow the steps below to load the geodata:

On the user page or on the sidebar select geodata option and you will be brought to the page shown below:

![](./media/app-image1.png)

The button labeled "RETRIEVE" when clicked will load the new geodata into your application so that it will show all the areas on the dashboard, planner and data collector modules.

A red progress bar will be shown to show that it is loading something, wait till it is finished and then you can continue using the application:

![](./media/app-image60.png)

The loading bar is shown below with the red rectangle:

![](./media/app-image75.png)

If the user wants to save the geodata onto their device in their downloads folder, the "DOWNLOAD" button is another option. By clicking the same geodata file that the application administration uploaded on the server will be downloaded to your computer. When clicked it instantly downloads it and you will find it in your downloads folder.

![](./media/app-image71.png)

 

**Logout**
----------

Open the sidebar by using the sandwich button on the top right corner of the screen and click on the Logout link from the options presented.

![](./media/app-image56.png)

**NOTE**: if you log out while you are offline, you won\'t be able to use DiSARM again until you login (which you can only do if you\'re online).

**Known limitations**
---------------------

It is not possible to make a plan, on the planner module, while using a mobile device. The panel type is not used in the app which makes it not possible to touch areas on the mobile cell phone's screen in order to include them in the plan.
