# DHIS2 integration example

Using the API approach, algorithms can be accessed from external applications. We demonstrated this by integrating with [DHIS2](https://www.dhis2.org/). 

As an example use-case, we predict disease prevalence at locations from a survey, using a DiSARM algorithm which predicts prevalence based on climatological and environmental data. Using a DHIS2 app, we send survey data and locations from a sample of health facilities to the DiSARM algorithm, which estimates prevalence for all health facilities. The results are mapped and charted inside the DHIS2 dashboard.

This is fully-documented here [https://github.com/disarm-platform/dhis2-integration](https://github.com/disarm-platform/dhis2-integration), including example code and scripts. You can also watch [the overview video](https://youtu.be/NcdwEKADarw).
