# DiSARM API Infrastructure

We use three main open source components in the DiSARM API infrastructure:
- [OpenFaas](https://docs.openfaas.com/) - Functions-as-a-service platform
- [Portainer](https://portainer.readthedocs.io) - container management
- [Traefik](https://docs.traefik.io/) - reverse proxy to handle routing

Configuration is documented and described in the [`disarm-faas-docker`](https://github.com/disarm-platform/disarm-faas-docker) repo, in both the README and [the wiki](https://github.com/disarm-platform/disarm-faas-docker/wiki).
