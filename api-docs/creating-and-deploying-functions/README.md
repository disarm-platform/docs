# Creating and deploying algorithms

## Note on terminology

We use _function_ and _algorithm_ interchangeably, to describe any piece of code which can be packaged and deployed, and performs a specific task or process.

The following documentation is designed to support the creation and deployment of algorithms written in R or Python. If you just want to deploy one of the \[existing DiSARM algorithms\], you can jump straight to the section on [Running algorithms](https://docs.disarm.io/api-docs/using-the-api).

Watch a [real-time walkthrough](https://youtu.be/67HUwyt3PoA) of creating an infrastructure from scratch, using Docker Playground, OpenFaaS and a new \(simple!\) function from a template \(12 minutes\). Note that this video is designed to give a brief overview of the process but is not designed to be the main support tool for creating and deploying algorithms. For this, refer to the next sections.
