# Troubleshooting functions

Sometimes they just don't work... Here's what you can try.

1. Make sure the built container works fine on your local machine: not just the code, but the actual container. See [Testing local function containers](testing-local-function-containers.md).
2. Remove the function from OpenFaas and redeploy \(`faas rm` then `faas up` or `faas deploy`\). This will give you the best chance of figuring out if you have a reproducible problem. Just redeploying might not help.
3. There are debug logs for each container, but theyâ€™re turned off by default. If we turn them on, they log _all_ input and output, so we want to be careful about using them. Note: if you're working only with URLs for data files \(rather than serialising data into the requests\), it's easier when you log everything out.
