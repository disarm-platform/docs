# Using user interfaces to access the algorithms

For each of the DiSARM algorithms, we have built simple web-accessible user interfaces to demonstrate the functioning of the algorithms. See the [Algorithm-specific links](../algorithm-specific-links.md) for details of each. This is the simplest and fastest way for someone without the required software skills to be able to interact with the deployed algorithms.
