# Starting a containerized algorithm

Once you've build a container, you need to 'run' it to get it ready to be used. Again, we use OpenFaas functions to do this. 

1. Navigate to the folder with the relevant `stack.yml` file.
2. Using the `image` name from `stack.yml`, something like `disarm/fn-covariate-extractor:0.0.2` , run this command, substituting the `image` name:

```bash
docker run -it --rm -p 8080:8080 -e read_timeout=600 -e write_timeout=600 -e exec_timeout=600 -e combine_output=false disarm/fn-covariate-extractor:0.0.2
```

* This will get it running locally on port 8080 \(you might need to change the _first_ `8080` if there's a conflict on your machine\).
* Should print a few lines and then wait. You can kill it by pressing CTRL+C in this terminal

  ```bash
    ❯ docker run -it -p 8080:8080 disarm/fn-covariate-extractor:0.0.2
