# DiSARM API Infrastructure

_For a very quick-start, watch a_ [_real-time walkthrough_](https://youtu.be/67HUwyt3PoA) _of creating an infrastructure from scratch, using Docker Playground, OpenFaaS and a new \(simple!\) function from a template \(12_ minutes\).

We use three main open source components in the DiSARM API infrastructure:

* [OpenFaas](https://docs.openfaas.com/) - Functions-as-a-service platform
* [Portainer](https://portainer.readthedocs.io) - container management
* [Traefik](https://docs.traefik.io/) - reverse proxy to handle routing

Configuration is documented and described in the [`disarm-faas-docker`](https://github.com/disarm-platform/disarm-faas-docker) repo, in both the README and [the wiki](https://github.com/disarm-platform/disarm-faas-docker/wiki).
