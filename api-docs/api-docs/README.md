# Managing an example API infrastructure

The section on 'Running algorithms' outlines how to run and use a containerized algorithm locally. If you have multiple algorithms, or want to have more flexibility in terms of who can access your algorithm, it requires a different approach. There are now multiple ways to build and manage an API. The DiSARM project has made use of OpenFaas, an open-source infrastructure for building serverless applications. 

The following sections take you through our approach.
